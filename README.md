# fli-data-analysis
This repo contains various code used for processing and analysis of the data from the FLI (Leibniz-Institut für Alternsforschung - Fritz-Lipmann-Institut)

## Setup
- Install python packages by ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
- Please copy the file ```.env_example``` and store it as a new file ```.env``` (which is not meant to be stored in git).
Fill the values in the ```.env``` file - these are various credentials (which is why they are not commited to the repository.)
